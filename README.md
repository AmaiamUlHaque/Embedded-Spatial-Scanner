An embedded system that uses a time-of-flight sensor and a rotary mechanism to perform 360° spatial scans. It captures distance measurements within a plane, stores the data onboard, and transmits it to a PC or web app for 3D reconstruction and visualization.  #EmbeddedSystems #LiDAR #3DReconstruction
